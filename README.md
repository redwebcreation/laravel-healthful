## Installation

> Requires [PHP 8.0+](https://php.net/releases)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require redwebcreation/laravel-healthful
```

The package will automatically register itself.

You'll need to publish the migrations if you're using the `SchedulerCheck` or the `QueueCheck`:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="healthful-migrations"
```

Optionally you can publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="healthful-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
<?php

use RWC\Healthful\Checks\DatabaseCheck;
use RWC\Healthful\Checks\QueueCheck;
use RWC\Healthful\Checks\SchedulerCheck;

return [
    /**
     * A list of checks to be performed.
     */
    'checks' => [
        DatabaseCheck::class,
        SchedulerCheck::class,
        QueueCheck::class,
    ]
];
```

## Usage

Check if your application is healthy :

```php
use RWC\Healthful\Facades\Health;

Health::check();
```

It returns true if all the checks were true or false if one failed.

You may want to expose your application's health publicly :

```php
use RWC\Healthful\Facades\Health;

Health::route()->name('healthcheck');
```

It registers a route at `/_/health` that returns a 200 if all the checks passed, or a 503 if one of them doesn't.

You can configure the URI via the `Health::$route` property :

```php
use RWC\Healthful\Health;

Health::$route = '/healthcheck';
```

### Custom checks

```php
// app/HealthChecks/IsMondayCheck.php
use RWC\Healthful\Checks\Check;

class IsMondayCheck implements Check {
    public function passes() : bool{
        // Monday is never healthful.
        return !now()->isMonday();
    }
}
```

```php
// config/healthful.php
return [
    // ...
    IsMondayCheck::class
];
```

### Integration with Docker

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=1m --timeout=30s --retries=3 CMD curl --fail http://localhost/_/health || exit 1
```

## Testing
